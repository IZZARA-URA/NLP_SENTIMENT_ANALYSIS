# NLP_SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS

# Simple Sentiment Analysis
This tutorial covers the workflow of a PyTorch with torchtext project. We'll learn how to: load data, create train/test/validation splits, build a vocabulary, create data iterators, define a model and implement the train/evaluate/test loop. The model will be simple and achieve poor performance, but this will be improved in the subsequent tutorials.
